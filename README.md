# Healthcare Data Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
The **Healthcare Data Analysis Dashboard** is an interactive **Power BI** project designed to analyze and visualize healthcare facility data, focusing on patient demographics, visit patterns, wait times, satisfaction levels, and departmental referrals.  
The dashboard provides actionable insights to help healthcare administrators improve patient experience, optimize staffing, and enhance operational efficiency.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze patient visit trends across different time periods (daily, monthly, quarterly, yearly).
- Understand wait time distributions to identify potential areas for improvement.
- Study patient demographics by age group, gender, and race.
- Track departmental referrals to manage resource allocation.
- Measure patient satisfaction scores for quality assessment.
